<h1>Uncovering Gender Gaps in Diplomacy: Insights from SQL Analysis</h1>

<p>
  I used SQL on PostgreSQL to analyze gender disparities in global diplomatic missions from 1961 to 2021, with a focus on Italy. 
  
  This project highlighted significant trends in gender representation worldwide and especially within the Italian context, offering a clear snapshot of an issue that demands awareness. 
  Developed during the SQL course at start2impact, it reflects my commitment to using data to raise awareness about the gender gap.
